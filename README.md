# Customer Segmentation:
A machine learning project to segment customers based on their spending and income habits.

## Project Overview:
-This project analyzes customer data to identify distinct groups, or segments, within a mall's customer base. 

-The primary goal is to use unsupervised learning to create meaningful customer clusters. 

-This allows for tailored marketing strategies and personalized promotions that can enhance customer engagement and revenue.

## Dataset:
-The dataset Mall_Customers.csv is used for this project.

-It contains 200 records with 5 features, including both numerical and categorical variables.

-The features provide a comprehensive view of customer demographics and spending behavior, which are essential for effective segmentation.

## Workflow:
The process involves:

-Loading and preprocessing the dataset.

-Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features.

-Applying the K-Means clustering algorithm using Annual Income and Spending Score to segment the customers.

-Determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

-Visualizing the resulting customer segments.

## Tools & Libraries:

The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

-Python

-Pandas – For data handling and manipulation.

-NumPy – For numerical operations.

-Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization.

-Scikit-learn – For clustering and evaluation.
